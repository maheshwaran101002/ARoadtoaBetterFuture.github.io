        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>“Dreams are not those which come while we are sleeping, but dreams are those when you don’t sleep before fulfilling them” - <b>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam</b></p>
        <p>This story features a boy named Ram who lives in Madurai. He likes to explore many places and encounters challenges that he overcomes with dreams and imagination.</p>
        <p>I hope that, by reading this book everyone will realize the impact of their 
            actions which they are causing to the future generation…</p>

        <p><strong></strong></p>

        <p>When Ram was asleep, he heard a lot of loud noise from the adjoining room 
            where his parents slept. He woke up quick enough to hear his parents 
            quarrelling. Soon he came to know that, he was the reason for the quarrel. Both
            of them claimed that, the other one was the reason for his moodiness which 
            affects his academic performance. Ram’s father shouted at his mother, “You are 
            not taking care of Ram properly, you are not even teaching him.” Mother said, 
            “Why can’t you spend time with him daily instead of watching episodes.” 
            Ram felt very sad and started to sob silently till he could not sob anymore and 
            he slept. The next morning, his mother came inside his room to wake him up. 
            Ram was very tired as he couldn’t sleep last night because of the incident that 
            took place. But still he woke up and got ready to school. He sat at the dining
            table and he saw a plate full of healthy breakfast. Moodily he started to have his 
            breakfast. After tasting 2 spoons he put it in the dustbin without the knowledge 
            of his mother. His mother asked him, “How was the food?” but there was no 
            answer. Mother looked back only to find that Ram was rushing up the stairs to 
            pack his bag. Ram packed his bag and came down. He saw his father waiting 
            for him at the bottom of the stairs with a small gift wrapped in a blue coloured 
            paper. His mother hugged him and gave him a kiss and said, “Good Bye Ram.” 
            But she received complete silence as a reply. Before she could say anything, the 
            bus arrived. Ram quickly ran and got on to the bus. 
            Ram sat inside the bus and thought, “My parents really don’t like me, they are 
            showing me fake love, my life would be better if I never had parents. Yesterday 
            they were scolding me, now they are giving me this gift.”
            Angrily he kept the gift inside the bag without opening it and took out his 
            gaming console to play his favourite game Naruto. 
            As soon as he switched on the console, he found out, that its battery was dead. 
            Crossly he took the battery out and threw it out of the window. Suddenly the bus 
            stopped giving a violent jerk which set his console flying and it hit the front seat
            with a thud. The console broke into two pieces. He took the broken pieces of the 
            console in his hand and found that it was useless now. Filled with rage he threw 
            it out of the window. 
            Filled with boredom and with the irritating noise of other excited students who 
            were enjoying the ride, he sat inside the bus all alone. By the time he realized 
            that the bus has reached school and everyone has got down. 
            Slowly he got off the bus and saw the newly planted saplings. He started 
            uprooting the saplings and took it to his classroom. 
            </p>

            <p>Once he reached the class he saw that his classmates were taking and having 
                fun. Ram really wanted to join them but something stopped him from doing so. 
                At that time a boy noticed that Ram was sitting alone and offered to join him in 
                the game. Ram was hesitant to join and, he simply ignored the request. 
                Soon the bell rang and the class started. English teacher entered the class and 
                requested all the students to give their ideas about “How will life be after 300 
                years.” 
                Everyone started giving their opinions about the given topic. She got many 
                answers like State of the art futuristic gadgets, flying cars, super suits, and 
                teleportation using wormholes, black holes and existence of extra-terrestrial
                beings. But Ram sat in his place silently. Finally, she asked Ram to give his own 
                opinion. Ram stood there clueless; the teacher scolded Ram for not answering. 
                He angrily replied “I don’t want any future.” The whole class was shocked to 
                hear Ram shout. Ram became embarrassed and asked sorry to her. She 
                reluctantly replied “It’s okay Ram, meet me at the staff room during the long 
                break.”
                After sometime, the bell rang and all the students left for the P.T class. Ram had 
                the classroom to himself. He sat next to the window and started thinking about 
                what has happened to him during the previous period. He felt that the way he 
                behaved to others was very bad. He himself knew that there was nothing he 
                could do to change this. Ram wanted to burst into tears at the thought of this. He 
                looked out of the window and admired the scenery. This helped him to relax
                himself. Soon he fell asleep. 
                Suddenly Ram opened his eyes and realized that he was having difficulty in 
                breathing. He heard a noise above his head. Ram followed his instinct and 
                looked up only to see bright light everywhere. From a distance he saw a group 
                of things dressed in suits which looked like space suits. Frightened, Ram started
                to run as fast as he could, thinking that if he stayed there any longer, he will be 
                kidnapped by extra-terrestrial beings from another planet. 
                Suddenly everything was blurred for him and he fainted. When he began to 
                regain consciousness, he realized that he was flying in a space ship like thing. 
                He began to feel that his body is feeling different and he was able to breathe. 
                Surprised, Ram looked at himself in a mirror-like object. Only then he realized
                that he was also wearing the same suit as the people who chased him. 
                He saw few things, wearing a suit only when he looked at it keenly, he
                understood that they were people like him dressed in suits. Ram felt very thirsty 
                and asked the suit man near him for some water. The suit man handed him a small diamond like bubble. Ram refused it and thought that these people were 
                not able to understand English. He tried to use sign language to communicate 
                with them. By seeing his actions, the people understood that Ram thought that 
                they did not understand English and one suit man said, “Hey boy, we understand 
                English! But we don’t understand what you are asking for.” Ram replied,
                “Please give me a bottle of water.”
                </p>
                <p>All of suit men were shocked to hear this answer. One among them came 
                    forward and said, “A bottle of water!!! What do you mean by bottle of water? 
                    This is the water we get here.” They started to discuss among themselves. Ram 
                    heard comments like “Where is this boy from? Is he from another planet with 
                    plenty of water?” “Maybe this boy has some damage in his brain because of not 
                    wearing the oxygen suit for a long time.”
                    Suddenly one suit man says, “No, what he is saying maybe true, I have read 
                    some inscriptions written before 300 years stating that, during that period 
                    people had plenty of water to drink and used it for domestic purposes.” Another 
                    suit man said, “I told you all before that, he has time travelled.”
                    Hearing these comments Ram felt very confused, asked the suit man, “What is 
                    today’s date?” The suit man said, “It is 6
                    th of February 2323.” By hearing this 
                    Ram was shocked and he had the water bubble.
                    Ram questioned himself like, “How am I here? Where are my mom and dad?
                    Why am I here? Did I live for 300 years? How can I not remember anything that 
                    happened all these years? How can I go back to home?”
                    Meanwhile his stomach was grumbling and he felt hungry. He asked the suit 
                    man, “I’m so hungry. Can I have something to eat?” The suit man replied, “Here
                    take these tablets, the yellow one is for your protein needs, red one is for your 
                    fat needs and this small white one is for your calcium needs.” 
                    Ram replied, “What? Am I having any deficiency? Why do I need these 
                    supplements? I need yummy food like idly, sambar, rice with some veggies.”
                    Again, all of them were confused and tried to explain the situation to Ram. They 
                    said, “Look out of the window my boy, do you see any vegetation? The only 
                    thing we can see is piles and piles of E waste and non-degradable wastes. The 
                    tablets which we gave you now are the only food we have been consuming for 
                    many generations.”
                    Now, Ram was very sad and he recollected his actions that he did throughout 
                    the day like, disrespecting the food which his mother cooked with lots of love 
                    and care, ignoring the conversation with his classmates, rude behaviour with his English teacher, throwing out the batteries and broken gaming console outside 
                    the window of the bus, uprooting the small saplings and all.
                    </p>
                    <p>Suddenly, he remembered the gift which his dad gave him that day morning. 
                        Hurriedly he took the gift from the school bag saying to the suit man that, “No it 
                        is not 2323, It is my birthday today 2023. See this gift was given to me by my 
                        dad today morning.
                        The suit man replied, “No, it is impossible. Here the lifespan of the average 
                        human is only 30 years due to lack of nutrients, oxygen, water, mental health 
                        and stressful lifestyle so the kids above ten years won’t have parents.
                        Astonished Ram replied, “No my parents were with me just this morning, if it is 
                        as you say what happened to my parents? And what will happen to me?
                        The suit man said, “The government adopts the children and they live in the 
                        adoption centres that are organized by the government, right now we are on our 
                        way to leave you in one of the adoption centres.
                        Ram was dumbstruck and couldn’t control his tears from flowing down his 
                        cheeks, remembered the thought that occurred to him that morning which was
                        “Life will be better without parents.” When he thought of this he wanted to 
                        burst into tears as he couldn’t bear the thought of life without his parents.
                        His body started to shiver and he was not able to breathe he tried his best to take 
                        a breath but he couldn’t. He started to hear voices saying, Ram…Ram…Ram 
                        are you ok?
                        Abruptly Ram took a deep breath and woke up with a start only to open his eyes 
                        and see that he was surrounded by his classmates and his teacher who had 
                        worried looks on their faces.
                        Just then Ram realized that this was not 300 years in the future but it was a 
                        dream because of the topic discussed in class.</p>
                        <p><b>Even though Ram knew that this is only a dream, the impact of it still 
                            stayed with him and he realized his mistakes and wanted to correct them.</b></p>

                            <p>As soon as the school was over, he rushed to his English teacher and asked sorry 
                                for his behaviour in the classroom. And also, he said thank you. His teacher did 
                                not understand what was going on, but she was very happy after seeing the 
                                smile on the boy’s face, who was always moody. 
                                He decided to walk home as it was near by school. He went to the lawn and 
                                replanted all the saplings that he uprooted. 
                                On the way home he found the battery and the broken gaming console and he 
                                kept it in recycling bin.
                                The moment he went home he gave his mom a tight hug and thanked her for 
                                everything she has done for him. He also promised his mom that he would 
                                never waste anyone’s hard work and effort. His mom didn’t know the reason for 
                                his sudden change but still she felt happy that her son realized his mistakes and 
                                she too. 
                                After this he leaves a note to his dad saying, </p>
                                <p><b>“Thank you dad, Good Night, "A Road to a better future” 
                                    started today...."</b></p>
